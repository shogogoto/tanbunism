# Adventure rights

One right per server-clock half-hour slot (:00/:30), no accumulation. GET is
read-only; POST consumes the authenticated user's current slot under a User-node
write lock. Admin reset clears only the target user's consumed-slot marker.

`adventure_consumed_slot` and `adventure_access_lock` are internal Cypher-managed
User properties, intentionally absent from public/editable account schemas.
No new schema/index install is required; no orphan nodes are created. Deleting a
User also removes these fields. They must not be copied as learning history.

HP, battles and dungeon clears remain device-local prototype state. These APIs
authorize starting/resuming an event, not validate every combat action. Learning
XP is still managed by its existing ledger. Reset does not heal, alter XP, or
restart an ongoing battle. A right consumed just before a clock boundary recovers
at that boundary. Pending events do not accumulate or auto-restart.
